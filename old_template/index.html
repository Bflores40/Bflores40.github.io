								The majority of my work involves using the publicly available, radiative transfer code <a href="http://kookaburra.phyast.pitt.edu/hillier/web/CMFGEN.htm">CMFGEN</a>, 
								developed and maintained by my research advisor, <a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/d-john-hillier">Dr. John Hillier</a>. 
								This code was designed to solve the radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations in spherical geometry.  It has been designed for application to W-R stars, O stars, 
								and Luminous Blue-Variables. With this code, I am currently working on the following projects:

								<b>Project I: Using "Shells" to characterize clumping in stellar winds</b>
								<br> Radiatively driven winds of hot, massive stars have been shown to be inherently unstable, leading to the formation of an inhomogeneous
								structure called clumps (for an overview, see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2008A&ARv..16..209P/abstract">Puls et al. 2008</a>).
								Further, synthetic spectra from radiative transfer codes that do not correct for clumping have been shown to be inconsistent with observations.
								As such, the analysis of massive star spectra requires an allowance for the inhomogeneous properties of their winds, especially if our goal is 
								to derive accurate stellar quantities such as mass-loss rates and abundances.
								<br>
								<br> Dr. Hillier and I are implementing the use of "Shells" - highly dense regions embedded in the wind - to treat clumping in CMFGEN. Doing so 
								allows us to study clump-sensitive features in the star's spectra and make comparison with the volume-filling factor approach, a method 
								widely adopted in radiative transfer code for treating clumping. Currently, a paper is in prep for publication (Using Shell Models to Investigate Clumping in the O7Iaf+ Supergiant AzV83)
								that uses the Shell method to sythesize spectra for comparison with those observed from an O star,
								<a href ="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=azv+83&submit=SIMBAD+search"> AzV 83</a>.
								<br>
								<br> In an upcoming paper, we'll expand on this method and make comparison with spectra observed from a Wolf-Rayet star, 
								<a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=HD50896&submit=SIMBAD+search"> HD 50896 </a>.
								
								<! â€“ features that depend linearly on density (e.g., electron scattering wings many UV P Cygni profiles in O stars) cannot be fitted
								with the same mass loss that is needed to match most emission features (e.g., H&alpha; emission in O stars); the occurrence of P Cygni profiles of
								so-called super-ions (O VI &lambda;&lambda;1031; 1037 and N V &lambda;&lambda;1238; 1242) which are inconsistent with smooth homogeneous winds; and 
								phosphorus abundances derived from spectroscopic studies of O stars may differ from the global abundance trends if clumping is ignored. >

								<b>Project II: Incorperating Convections to CMFGEN for NLTE modeling of Yellow Supergiants</b>
								<br>Another problem that I have started looking into involves yellow supergiants (YSGs) - an intermediate phase in a 20 - 40 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>
								star's evolution that is short-lived (on the order of 1% or less of its lifetime). Their numbers and location on the evolutionary path are 
								sensitive to the uncertainties in the treatment of their winds and convection. As Kippenhanh & Weigert (1990, p. 468) puts it \[The yellow supergiant]
								phase is a sort of magnifying glass, revealing relentlessly the faults of calculations of earlier phases." More recently, a puzzle 
								came to light when a Type IIb Supernova (SN), SN IIb 2011dh, was observationally confirmed to have a YSG progenitor (see 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...95M/abstract"> Maeda et. al. 2014 </a>). Type IIb SNe are thought to have 
								progenitors of evolved stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.
								<br>
								<br>From our current understanding of the star's YSG phase, it represent a key transition phase where its mass-loss rate will help dictate 
								future stages of its life. However, CMFGEN is ill-equiped to model the atmosphere and winds of these objects since convective cells are expected
								to form just below the photosphere. Thus, I'm currently working on implenting convection to CMFGEN and test it with another code that has already 
								implented, ATLAS9.
